This mod took hundreds of hours of work and is constantly updated in response to Asobo's own updates which often require revisions of working mods. Though this package is free to all, I welcome donations which help me devote more time to updating the Turbo Bonanza. A modest donation from a significant proportion of users makes a huge difference and is very much appreciated. Each Donor receives a personalised thank you and acknowledgement.

This mod will enable the Bonanza to achieve 212 knots (243 mph) at 17,500 ft on cruise power and up to 222 knots (255 mph) on full power! It will climb at 1400 fpm at sea level and has full manifold pressure of 29+ inches all the way up to 18,000 feet. The ceiling is now extended to 25,000 feet

The turbo-aspirated Bonanza vastly increases the climb and cruise performance of the default Bonanza G36 and is based on turbo conversions available in the aviation industry for real Bonanza G36 and A36 owners. It is therefore not a fictional mod but faithfully re-creates the features and power of the turbo conversion.

Included are:

* Re-mapped turbo-powered engine for stunning performance
* Nine custom liveries.
* Brighter navigation and strobe lights
* Ambient wing lighting
* Brighter and much longer range landing & taxi lights
* Subtle light reflections on tarmac surfaces
* Re-positioned and re-calibrated interior light for better visibility
* Better suspension and landing gear handling on the ground.
* Adjusted wheel brakes for easier differential brake-turning
* Elimination of twitchy rudder on the ground and take-off run
* Full steering angle at low speeds yet controllable at high speeds
* Rock steady autopilot at normal simulator speed at all altitudes
* Elimination of random twitchy behaviour in non turbulent conditions
* Temp gauges more realistic
* More accurate fuel flow
* Engine changed to 6 cylinders with correct displacement
* Elimination of “baked in” artificial oscillations that are not weather related
* Elimination of artificial movement not related to landscape or air mass
* Harmonised and balanced controls with no pitch bobbing up and down
* Accurate aileron authority and roll rates at all airspeeds
* Proper spins rather than the default spiral dive
* Full side slip capability with up to 30 degrees slip angle
* Correct climb rates and cruise speeds for the turbo version
* A complete overhaul of flight dynamics
* Compatible with Working-Title's G1000 mod
